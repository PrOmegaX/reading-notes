***Class 1 reading notes***

OK to understand Markdown you have to understand syntax first  which is
basically combinations of symbols that translate into expressions/structured
statements into the language you'd see on a website. Now Markdown utilizes a 
unique syntax to achieve your desired outcome such as Italics, strikeout, BOLD etc...

Say for instance you wanted to make a header ok well you want as big as you could
go and bold type 3 stars in front ***TITLE*** <---3 in back to close it off. which
will translate on you website a big title at the top in bold.

Markdown and HTML rub shoulders but rest assured are DIFFERENT! Markdown is easier
to write than HTML for one, and for two it's easier to read. Altho you can express
more on HTML but when you cant. achieve something in markdown HTML still comes in handy.
